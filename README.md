# movie-recommender-system-imdb-dataset  
A content-based movie recommender system using cosine similarity.  

## Overview  
This project is a **movie recommendation system** that suggests movies based on their similarity to a given movie. It uses **cosine similarity** to compare movie features such as genres, cast, and keywords, providing accurate recommendations.  

## Features  
- Uses **cosine similarity** for content-based filtering  
- Processes movie data from the **IMDb dataset**  
- Suggests similar movies based on genre, cast, and description  

## Technologies Used  
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  

## How It Works  
1. The system extracts important features from the dataset.  
2. It converts text data into numerical vectors.  
3. **Cosine similarity** is used to measure similarity between movies.  
4. Based on similarity scores, the system recommends movies related to the input.  

## Usage  
Run the script, input a movie title, and get a list of recommended movies.
